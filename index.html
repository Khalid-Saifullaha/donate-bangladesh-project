            <p> The flood situation in Noakhali has worsened due to continuous rain and upstream water, leading many people to seek shelters. However, space is unavailable in remote areas, forcing many to live in waterlogged conditions.The flood situation further deteriorated in the district town of Maizdi and in the Sadar upazila. Meanwhile, residents have reported that relief is not properly reaching many remote areas of the district. Flood victims are desperately seeking aid.

              Currently, 21,25,500 people in 87 unions across 8 upazilas of the district are stranded due to flooding. The number of people taking shelter in 1,303 shelters is 2,64,743.
              
              Locals have observed some improvement in the flood situation in Senbagh, Kabirhat, and Companiganj upazilas in the last 24 hours.

            <p> In neighbouring Bangladesh, authorities said at least 12 people died and scored of others wounded as Fani swung northeastwards into the country.

              At least four of those deaths were reported from Kishorganj district in central Bangladesh. “They died after they were struck by lightning. There have been heavy rains and storm here since Friday noon,” the district’s Deputy Commissioner Sarwar Murshed Chowdhury told Al Jazeera.
              
              Kabir Ahmed, Deputy Commissioner of Barguna district, said an elderly woman and her grandson died around 3 am on Saturday morning after a tree fell on their tin-shed home.After it made landfall early on Friday, tropical cyclone Fani had lost some of its power and was downgraded to a ‘Deep Depression’ by the Indian Meteorological Department as the storm moved inland over Bangladesh.

              A storm surge still breached embankments to submerge dozens of villages on Bangladesh’s low-lying coast, a disaster ministry official in Dhaka said.
              
              “We are mooring our boat because it’s the only means of income for us. Only Allah knows when we can go back to fishing again,” Akbar Ali, a fisherman near the town of Dacope in Bangladesh, told AFP news agency while battling surging waves to tie his boat to a tree.

            <p> During the blockade, many vehicles were stuck.

              At the police and local administration's request, the protesters re-entered the campus. Shortly after, a cocktail explosion near the administration building injured four students.
              
              Later, protesting students rescued them and admitted them to Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital. 
              
              Following the incident, leaders and activists of Chhatra League, Swechchhasebak League and Awami League were seen at the college after a procession. 
              
              Among the injured, Tafsir said: “We blocked the Tinmatha-Satmatha road in front of the college as part of the quota-reform movement."
              
              After about half an hour, he said, they were returning to the campus when the sudden cocktail explosion occurred, injuring several. 
              
              However, he could not clearly say who launched the attack, but he suspected that those who support quotas were responsible.
              
              Government Azizul Haque College Principal Prof Khondokar Kamal Hasan said: “The administration has been informed, various government agencies have collected information, and they will identify those involved in the attack and take legal action against them.”</p>
